= TS_REST_API

This project is based on https://github.com/aligoren/express-typescript-test and uses link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/[Typescript] and link:https://expressjs.com/[expressjs].

But I think there is not so much left from it as I tried to align this project to my link:https://github.com/steffakasid/rest-api[Go API sample]. Also it shows how to register routes and middlewares.

== Usage

Just run

[source,sh]
----
npm install

npm start
----
